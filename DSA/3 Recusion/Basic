-->> in recursion we have mainly 2 subparts
                (1) base case condition or terminating condition
                (2) Recursive code

-->> Syntax : 
        functionName(parameter){
            if(base condition){
                return ; 
            } else{
                result = functionName(changed parameter)
            } return result ;
        }

-->> For finding a space and time complexity we will solve the recurance relation.
        There are three methods of solving reccrunce relation
                (1) substitution method
                (2) recursive tree method
                (3) Master's Theorem

---->>>> iteration is best compare to the recursion because of the space complexityexity was higher compare to the iteration
