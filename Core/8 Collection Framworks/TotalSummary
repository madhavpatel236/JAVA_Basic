------->>>>>>>>>> in the collection we have mainlly 3 parts
                    (i) list
                    (ii) set
                    (iii) Queue

------->>>>>>>>>> Arraylist : - in the arraylist we can add the value at a specific index no.
- in Arraylist element can add  one by one so we can say that insertion order was preserve.
- in Arraylist we can add homogenous and Hetirogenous both type of data. 


------->>>>>>>>>> LinkedList : in linkedlist we can add the value at a specific index no.
- in Linkedlist element can add  one by one so we can say that insertion order was preserve.
- in linkedlist we can add homogenous and Hetirogenous both type of data.

------->>>>>>>>>> ArrayDeque : in ArrayDeque we cannot add the element at a specific index.
- in ArrayDeque element can add  one by one so we can say that insertion order was preserve.
- in ArrayDeque we can add homogenous and Hetirogenous both type of data.

------>>>>>>>>>>> PriorityQueue :  in PriorityQueue we cannot add the element at a specific index.
- in PriorityQueue element cannot add one by one so we can say that insertion order was not preserve,because in PriorityQueue element can be add by priority number.
- in priorityQueue we can only add Homogenous type of data.
- we can add repeated element.

------->>>>>>>>>> TreeSet :  in TreeSet we cannot add the element at a specific index.
- in TreeSet element cannot add one by one so we can say that insertion order was not preserve,because in treeSet follows self-balencing-binaryTree.
- in TreeSet we can add the both type of data homogenous and Hetirogenous type of data.
